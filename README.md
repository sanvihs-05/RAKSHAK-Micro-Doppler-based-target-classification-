# 🎯 RAKSHAK: Micro-Doppler Signature Based Aerial Target Classification

## 🔍 About The Project

RAKSHAK is an advanced air defense system that leverages cutting-edge micro-Doppler radar technology combined with deep learning for real-time aerial target classification. By analyzing the unique frequency modulations caused by mechanical vibrations or rotations of target structures, RAKSHAK can differentiate between various aerial objects with remarkable precision.

### 🌟 Key Features

- Real-time micro-Doppler signature analysis using STFT
- Deep learning-based classification with ResNet50
- High accuracy (94%) with minimal latency (800ms)
- Streamlit-based interactive monitoring interface
- Scalable architecture for multiple radar arrays

## 🚀 Current Development

We're currently working on implementing the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for micro-Doppler signature plotting, following the mathematical model:

```python
X(τ, υ) = ∫_{-∞}^{∞} x(t)w(t - τ)exp(-jυt)dt
```

where:
- x(t) is the radar signal
- w(τ) is the window function
- X(τ, υ) represents the time-frequency decomposition

## 📊 Dataset

The project utilizes the DIAT-μSAT dataset from IEEE DataPort, which contains micro-Doppler signatures of Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAV). This comprehensive dataset enables robust training and validation of our classification models.
